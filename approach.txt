For this application to work as expected we need distinct colour generator function which generate 
32768 distinct colours.

=> Business Logic
    - For generating distinct colours I have created seprate function which store generated 
      colours in array.

    - First loop will iterate for 32 times and it will generate color for red.
    - Second nested loop will iterate for 32 times and it will generate color for green.
    - third nested loop will iterate for 32 times and it will generate color 
      for blue.

      So, loop will generate result like below
      rgb("0,0,0"), rgb("0,0,8")
      rgb("0,8,0"), rgb("0,8,8")
      rgb("8,0,0"), rgb("8,0,8")

    - In this approach its not possible that generate duplicate values as it is iterate in single direction loop.

    - For creating image I have used canvas and used useRef hook to display image on canvas.

=> For run test cases run command
    - npm run test
