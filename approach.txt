For this application to work as expected we need distinct colour generator function which generate 
32768 distinct colours.

=> Business Logic
    - For generating distinct colours I have created seprate function which uses bitwise operator to
      reduce time and space complexity and it will store generated colours in array.

    - For creating image I have used canvas and used useRef hook to display image on canvas.

=> For run test cases run command
    - npm run test
